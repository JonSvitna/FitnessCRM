# Railway Configuration for FitnessCRM Backend
# This configuration allows deploying the backend without manually setting Root Directory
# 
# Note: Commands include "cd backend" because this file is at the repository root.
# Railway executes commands from the root, so we navigate into backend/ first.

[build]
builder = "nixpacks"
buildCommand = "cd backend && pip install -r requirements.txt"

[deploy]
startCommand = "cd backend && gunicorn app:app"
restartPolicyType = "ON_FAILURE"
restartPolicyMaxRetries = 10

# Alternative: Set "Root Directory" to "backend" in Railway UI
# If you set Root Directory to "backend", Railway will automatically use
# the Procfile and nixpacks.toml in that directory instead of this config.
# Those files don't need "cd backend" since they're already in that directory.
