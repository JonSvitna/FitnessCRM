# Railway Configuration for FitnessCRM Backend
# This configuration allows deploying the backend without manually setting Root Directory

# Alternative: Set "Root Directory" to "backend" in Railway UI
# If you set Root Directory to "backend", Railway will automatically use
# the Procfile and nixpacks.toml in that directory instead of this config
