# Railway Configuration for FitnessCRM Backend
# 
# IMPORTANT: Set "Root Directory" to "backend" in Railway settings!
# Railway Dashboard → Your Service → Settings → Root Directory → Type: backend
#
# With Root Directory set to "backend":
# - Railway auto-detects Python from requirements.txt
# - Railway uses Procfile for start command
# - Railway installs dependencies automatically
# - No manual configuration needed!

restartPolicyType = "ON_FAILURE"

# Alternative: Set "Root Directory" to "backend" in Railway UI
# If you set Root Directory to "backend", Railway will automatically use
# the Procfile and nixpacks.toml in that directory instead of this config.
# Those files don't need "cd backend" since they're already in that directory.
