## 🚀 Quick Start

### Option 1: Docker Setup (Recommended)

The fastest way to get started is with Docker:

```bash
# Start all services (database, backend, frontend)
docker-compose up

# Initialize database with sample data (in another terminal)
docker-compose exec backend python init_db.py seed
```

Access the application at `http://localhost:3000`

### Option 2: Automated Setup Script

```bash
# Run the setup script
./setup.sh

# Follow the instructions to complete setup
```

### Option 3: Manual Setup

#### Prerequisites

- Node.js 18+ and npm
- Python 3.11+
- PostgreSQL 15+

#### Frontend Setup

```bash
cd frontend
npm install
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your API URL
npm run dev
```

The frontend will be available at `http://localhost:3000`

#### Backend Setup

```bash
cd backend
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
cp .env.example .env
# Edit .env with your database credentials
python app.py
```

The API will be available at `http://localhost:5000`

#### Database Setup
