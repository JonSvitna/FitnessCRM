# Nixpacks configuration for Python 3.11 backend
# Used when Root Directory is set to "backend" in Railway
#
# Note: This is NOT redundant with Procfile:
# - Nixpacks reads this file to set up the build environment
# - Procfile is a Railway/Heroku standard that can be used as an alternative
# - [start] section is REQUIRED by Nixpacks to define the start command
# - Railway will use this config when Root Directory is set to "backend"
